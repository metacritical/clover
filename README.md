# Clover

Clover is an incremental Native clojure compiler using handwritten LLVM bit code.
It is based on the ideas in Abdulaziz Ghuloum's paper An Incremental Approach to Compiler Construction and Joel F barletts paper on Scheme-to-C Compiler. 
Various implementation ideas are inspired from other lisp and scheme 
implementations namely like minilisp, LYSP and tinyscheme.

It is very much a Work in Progress... comeback soon.
